Automated Signal QC Demo (Synthetic Data)

This is a personal technical project demonstrating an automated quality-control workflow for structured, imaging-derived signals. It uses synthetic data only.

The notebook includes:

smoothing (Gaussian)

photobleach-style correction

feature detection (peak, depolarization start, repolarization metrics)

APD50 / APD90 extraction

automated filtering of invalid events

multi-ROI, multi-sheet batch processing

summary table generation

QC visualization

This demonstration is not tied to any real organization, project, or dataset. It is purely a standalone example of how I approach test automation, data validation, and reproducible analysis pipelines.
